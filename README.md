Welcome, how are you? In this repository contains a full app that support "State-Of-Art" models
of Google and Mistral


**Important: This version supports ONLY server models. 
If you need server-side and user-side models (who runs in his PC), please check out the server-and- edition at: 
Henriazz10/BondolAI-Local-and-Server**

## **Â¿How to use this code?**

To use this code, the only things that you need to do are;
- First, you clone  all the code in a folder on your PC
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Henriazz10/BondolAI-Server.git
  cd BondolAI-Server
  ```
- Then, you need to install all libraries of requeriments.txt
  ```bash
  python -m venv .venv
  .\.venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- After that you have to reemplace the keys of the code (In GeminiAPI, MistralAPI and in functions).
  
- Finally, you must to execute this comand in your .venv (Cmd):

   ```bash
    cd [DOWNLOAD_PATH]
    .venv\scripts\activate
    streamlit run main.py
   ```
  When you already complete this easy 4 steps, you can open the web browser and put "localhost:8501" and
  my app is going to work (I hope)
